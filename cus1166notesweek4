git branch -> lists current branch
git checkout master -> switches branch to desired branch
git branch use-case-001 -> makes a new branch   ==> use this convention
git pull -> pull most updated version of master branch
            - sometimes pulls down a merge conflict 

# merge master branch into feature branch
 NOT MASTER branch

git checkout use-case-002
the active branch that i'm in is the one that is being merged into

git merge master ==> conflict
consolidates the feature w the master branch
<<<HEAD current branch
>>>> Master branch youre merging from

IF you want to keep both 
do the staging and commit process again

IF You made a local new branch that you want to push to remote origin = remote branch
git push --set-upstream origin use-case-002
